# API Integration Demo

This project demonstrates a front-end application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Redux Toolkit**, showcasing efficient state management and API integration using **RTK Query**. It connects to a demo API to fetch and display data interactively.

## Features

- **React with TypeScript**: Strongly-typed, scalable front-end development.
- **State Management**: Simplified and efficient state handling using Redux Toolkit.
- **API Handling**: Integration with an API for data fetching, caching, and mutation through RTK Query.

## What I Learned

- Managing application state using Redux Toolkit.
- Simplifying API calls and caching with RTK Query.
- Building type-safe applications with TypeScript.
